Let’s update the TermiCool README to align with the streamlined script you requested, ensuring it reflects the enhanced features, developer tools, system utilities, and visual appeal while keeping it concise and user-friendly. As per your request, I’ll exclude the "Contributions" section and address the outdated or unclear elements in the original README (e.g., the keys command, which isn’t in the script, and the reload command, which needs clarification). I’ll also clarify the "Quotes" feature to remove ambiguity about "quotes about system info."

As a Socratic teacher, let’s reflect:

    What key features should we highlight to make TermiCool appealing to both developers and casual users?
    How can we make the installation process crystal clear for beginners?
    What customizations or commands should we emphasize to showcase the script’s power?

Here’s the updated README:
