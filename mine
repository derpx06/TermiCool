"Linux is a multi-user system, meaning that multiple people can use it at the same time without interfering with each other."
"Everything in Linux is treated as a file, including hardware devices. For example, your hard drive is represented as /dev/sda."
"The Linux kernel is the core part of the system that interacts with the hardware, managing resources like CPU, memory, and storage."
"In Linux, processes are managed by the kernel. Each process has a unique Process ID (PID) that helps the system track it."
"The shell in Linux is a command-line interface that lets you interact with the operating system by typing commands."
"Linux uses a hierarchical file system where everything starts from the root directory (/), and all files and directories branch from there."
"Permissions in Linux are key to security. Every file and directory has three types of permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x)."
"To change file permissions in Linux, use the 'chmod' command. For example, 'chmod 755 file.txt' gives read, write, and execute permission to the owner, and read and execute permissions to others."
"In Linux, the 'init' process (PID 1) is the first process started by the kernel and is responsible for starting all other processes on boot."
"Processes can communicate in Linux using signals. For example, 'kill -9 PID' sends a signal to terminate a process."
"The package manager in Linux is responsible for installing, updating, and removing software. In Arch Linux, this is 'pacman'."
"Linux uses a concept called 'virtual memory' where part of the hard drive is used as 'swap space' to store data when RAM is full."
"In Linux, there are two types of memory: RAM (used for currently running programs) and swap (used when RAM is full)."
"Linux uses 'cron' to schedule tasks to run at specified times, such as running backups every night."
"Processes in Linux are isolated from each other in user space, so one process cannot directly access the memory of another."
"In Linux, 'ps' and 'top' commands show information about running processes and system resource usage in real-time."
"Linux handles input/output through system calls. When you type a command or open a file, the kernel performs a system call to interact with hardware."
"Linux uses a concept called 'user space' for user-level programs, and 'kernel space' for low-level system code. They cannot directly access each other's memory."
"Linux has 'device drivers' that allow the operating system to communicate with hardware like printers, hard drives, and monitors."
"File system mounting in Linux allows the operating system to access and organize different storage devices. For example, 'mount /dev/sda1 /mnt' mounts the device /dev/sda1 to the /mnt directory."
"Linux can be customized extensively with environment variables. For example, setting 'export PATH=$PATH:/new/path' lets the system search for executables in a new location."
"Linux is case-sensitive, which means 'File.txt' and 'file.txt' are considered different files."
"In Linux, logging is done through the 'syslog' system, where system events and application logs are stored in files like '/var/log/syslog'."
"Linux uses 'soft links' (symlinks) and 'hard links' to create multiple references to the same file on disk."
"Kernel modules in Linux are pieces of code that can be loaded or unloaded to extend the kernel’s functionality, like supporting new hardware."
"Linux uses 'I/O schedulers' to manage how data is read from or written to storage devices, optimizing for speed or fairness depending on settings."
"In Linux, the 'sudo' command allows a user to run commands with administrative privileges, but only if they have permission."
"Linux uses 'pipes' (|) to allow the output of one command to be the input for another. For example, 'ls | grep file' lists files and then searches for 'file'."
"Linux uses 'semaphores' and 'mutexes' for synchronization, allowing processes to share resources safely without causing conflicts."
"One key feature of Linux is that it is open-source. This means anyone can view, modify, and distribute the source code of the kernel."
"Linux has a powerful networking system that allows you to configure and manage network connections, such as setting up static IPs or configuring firewalls."
"In Linux, 'mounting' is the process of attaching file systems to directories, which lets you work with files stored on other devices or partitions."
"Linux has a special directory '/proc' where you can access real-time system information, like process details and memory usage."
"In Linux, the 'bash' shell is used to interact with the system through commands. It’s responsible for interpreting and executing user input."
"Linux uses 'systemd' for managing services, such as starting or stopping applications and handling their logging."
"Linux filesystems have different types like ext4, xfs, and btrfs, each offering different features like compression and error detection."
"Linux handles multiple tasks using multitasking. It gives each process a small amount of CPU time, creating the illusion that many processes are running simultaneously."
"In Linux, 'cron' jobs allow you to schedule commands or scripts to run at specific intervals. It's useful for automating tasks like backups."
"In Linux, you can create aliases for commands with 'alias'. For example, 'alias ll='ls -al'' creates a shortcut for 'ls -al'."
